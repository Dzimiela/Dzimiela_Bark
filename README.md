# Dzimiela_Bark
Pulled down the Bark files from Dane Hillards Chapter 6 repository on the Bark.py to have a working place to start from. 

Items that I would like to be able to code to test for:

1. Does Book Title already Exist -- "Fetchone"
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45569344/how-to-tell-if-a-value-exists-in-a-sqlite3-database-python

2. Dictionary list of Inappropriate/not useful words.
Create flat list or database and then use similar "Fetchone" command as in #1 to do same checks upon creation.

3. Validation of Deletion event.
