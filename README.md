# Dzimiela_Bark
Pulled down the Bark files from Dane Hillards Chapter 6 repository on the Bark.py to have a working place to start from. 

Items that I would like to be able to code to test for:

1. Does Book Title already Exist
2. Dictionary list of Inappropriate/not useful words.
3. Validation of Deletion event.
